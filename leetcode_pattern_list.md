[1345. Jump Game IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-iv)

Given an array of integers arr, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

In one step you can jump from index i to index:

i + 1 where: i + 1 < arr.length.
i - 1 where: i - 1 >= 0.
j where: arr[i] == arr[j] and i != j.
Return the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

[2444. Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-with-fixed-bounds)

You are given an integer array nums and two integers minK and maxK.

A fixed-bound subarray of nums is a subarray that satisfies the following conditions:

The minimum value in the subarray is equal to minK.
The maximum value in the subarray is equal to maxK.
Return the number of fixed-bound subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
