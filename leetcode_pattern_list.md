[1345. Jump Game IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-iv)

Given an array of integers arr, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

In one step you can jump from index i to index:

i + 1 where: i + 1 < arr.length.
i - 1 where: i - 1 >= 0.
j where: arr[i] == arr[j] and i != j.
Return the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.


# 2. Binary Search
[2187. Minimum Time to Complete Trips](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-trips)

You are given an array time where time[i] denotes the time taken by the ith bus to complete one trip.

Each bus can make multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start immediately after completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates independently; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.

You are also given an integer totalTrips, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make in total. Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least totalTrips trips.

[2444. Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-with-fixed-bounds)

You are given an integer array nums and two integers minK and maxK.

A fixed-bound subarray of nums is a subarray that satisfies the following conditions:

The minimum value in the subarray is equal to minK.
The maximum value in the subarray is equal to maxK.
Return the number of fixed-bound subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
